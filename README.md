# Disney-Challenge

This project focused on obtaining Disney Amusement Park data and Disney Movie data to combine into a multifunctional website based around different Disney institutions.

Data was scraped from the internet for data on all movies produced by Disney as well as Disney Theme Park ride wait lines. Two different websites were used for scraping. API was created in jupyter notebook before creating a python scrape file to be used in flask. All data was put into tables that were loaded into SQL. The database would be called in the flask app for the necessary data.

A flask app was created to establish routes to each HTML page and to connect the API data to the appropriate HTML pages.

Finally the HTML page was put together to visualize all the collected Disney information. Additional information and analysis on Disney tourism and entertainment can be uploaded to the website as well.
