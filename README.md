# Disney-Challenge

The objective of this project was to scrape data about Disney's movies and thenme parks, then create a website. This would give the viewer insight on live wait times for all rides at Disney's theme parks and provide information about movies produced by Disney throught out the years. 

Jupyter Notebook was used for webscraping, while html/javascript/css were used for the front-end development.
